The purpose of the this analysis was to develop a nueral network model that could accurately predict
succesful ventures and those who would not be succeful Variables were analyzed to determine which factors would
make a successful applicant and any ways to improve the model.

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
IS SUCCESFUL
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
IS SUCCESFUL
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN and NAME
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No I was not able to achieve the traget of 75%, I was able to increase the 
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
